       "\"While Scrum offers numerous benefits, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks and address them appropriately. These cons should not discourage organizations from adopting Scrum but rather help them understand the challenges they may encounter and take steps to mitigate them. \\n\\nTo address the cons:\\n\\n1. Skilled Scrum Master: Organizations should invest in training and development programs to ensure that Scrum Masters have the necessary skills and expertise to effectively facilitate the Scrum process.\\n\\n2. Time management: Organizations should prioritize and optimize meetings to ensure they are productive and minimize any negative impact on actual work. This can be achieved by setting clear agendas, adhering to time limits, and leveraging technology to streamline communication.\\n\\n3. Predictability: While Scrum may have less predictability compared to traditional project management approaches, organizations can employ techniques like establishing clear goals, regularly reviewing and adjusting the product backlog, and leveraging historical data to improve predictability.\\n\\n4. Motivated and self-organizing team: Organizations should foster a positive and empowering work culture that encourages motivation and self-organization. Providing training, mentorship, and support can also help team members develop these skills.\\n\\n5. Documentation: While Scrum does prioritize working software, organizations can still create and maintain essential documentation to provide context and aid new team members or stakeholders. This documentation should be concise, accessible, and up-to-date.\\n\\n6. Inexperienced teams: Organizations should provide proper training and guidance to inexperienced teams to help them understand and implement Scrum effectively. Utilizing experienced Scrum Masters or coaches can also support their development and ensure the framework's success.\\n\\n7. Long-term planning: While Scrum focuses on short-term planning, organizations can incorporate higher-level planning techniques, such as roadmaps and release planning, to address long-term goals and requirements.\\n\\n8. Scope creep: Organizations can mitigate scope creep by establishing a clear scope and managing changes through effective prioritization and stakeholder engagement. Regular reviews and retrospectives can help identify and address scope creep early on.\\n\\n9. Scaling Scrum: For large-scale projects or organizations, organizations can consider implementing scaling frameworks such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) or LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum) to address the complexities and challenges associated with scaling Scrum.\\n\\n10. Effective communication: Organizations should prioritize and promote effective communication channels and practices, including regular and transparent communication among team members, stakeholders, and the Scrum Master. Establishing clear communication guidelines and addressing any breakdowns promptly can ensure effective collaboration.\\n\\nBy addressing these cons and implementing appropriate measures, organizations can maximize the benefits of Scrum while mitigating potential challenges, leading to successful project outcomes.\""

       "  'Title': 'Morocco quake deaths climb past 2,100, as rescuers race to find survivors',\n",
       "  'Text': 'On Sunday an aftershock of 4.5-magnitude rattled already-traumatised residents in the same region.  Friday’s 6.8-magnitude quake struck 72 km (45 miles) southwest of the tourist hub of Marrakesh, wiping out entire villages in the hills of the Atlas mountains.  The first foreign rescuers flew in to help after the North African country’s strongest-ever earthquake killed at least 2,122 people and injured more than 2,400, many seriously, according to official figures updated late on Sunday.  Using heavy equipment and even their bare hands, rescuers in Morocco on Sunday stepped up efforts to find survivors of a devastating earthquake that killed more than 2,100 people and flattened villages.  The mountain village of Tafeghaghte, 60 km from Marrakesh, was almost entirely destroyed, an Agence France-Presser team reported, with very few buildings still standing.  03:17 Morocco quake deaths climb past 2,000, as survivors rendered homeless Morocco quake deaths climb past 2,000, as survivors rendered homeless  Authorities declared three days of national mourning, but the Red Cross warned that it could take years to repair the damage in the deadliest quake to hit Morocco in more than 60 years and the strongest in around 120.  Advertisement  “I’ve lost everything,” said Lahcen, a resident of the village of Moulay Brahim, whose wife and four children were among those killed.  Many victims were still feared trapped under the rubble of their homes, often constructed from mud bricks.  Bouchra, another resident of Moulay Brahim, dried her tears with her scarf as she watched men wielding pickaxes to dig graves.  “My cousin’s grandchildren are dead,” she said. “I saw the devastation of the earthquake live and I’m still shaking. It’s like a ball of fire that swallowed up everything in its path.  Advertisement  “Everyone here has lost family, whether in our village or elsewhere in the region.”  With strong tremors also felt in the coastal cities of Rabat, Casablanca and Essaouira, the quake caused widespread damage and sent terrified residents and tourists scrambling to safety in the middle of the night.  People comfort each other in a village near Marrakech, while digging graves for victims of the earthquake. Photo: AP  “I was nearly asleep when I heard the doors and the shutters banging,” said Ghannou Najem, a Casablanca resident in her 80s who was visiting Marrakech when the quake hit. “I went outside in a panic. I thought I was going to die alone.”  Advertisement  In the mountain village of Tafeghaghte near the quake’s epicentre, virtually no buildings were left standing. The traditional clay bricks used by the region’s Berber inhabitants proved no match for the rare quake.  Soldiers continued to search through debris, but most survivors headed to the cemetery where loud screams punctuated the last rites as some 70 villagers were laid to rest.  “Three of my grandchildren and their mother were killed – they are still under the rubble,” said villager Omar Benhanna, 72. “Just a while ago, we were all playing together,” he added.  Advertisement  Al-Haouz province, site of the epicentre, suffered the most deaths with 1,293, followed by Taroudant province where 452 lives were lost, the authorities reported.  In Marrakech, Fatema Satir said there were many sleeping outside because of fear of their houses collapsing. “Our houses have been cracked, others destroyed, like my daughter’s house which was wiped out. We are in a chaotic state.”  The minaret of a mosque stands behind damaged and destroyed homes in the village of Moulay Brahim in Morocco’s Al-Haouz province. Photo: AFP  “Where destructive earthquakes are rare, buildings are simply not constructed robustly enough … so many collapse, resulting in high casualties,” said Bill McGuire, professor emeritus at Britain’s University College London.  Advertisement  Civil defence Colonel Hicham Choukri, who was leading relief operations, told state television the epicentre and strength of the earthquake created “an exceptional emergency situation”.  After a meeting chaired by King Mohammed VI, the palace announced three days of national mourning, with flags to fly at half-mast on all public buildings.  Faisal Badour, an engineer, said he felt the quake three times in his building in Marrakech. “The screaming and crying was unbearable,” he said.  Frenchman Michael Bizet, 43, who owns three traditional riad houses in Marrakesh’s old town, said he was in bed when the quake struck.  “I thought my bed was going to fly away. I went out into the street half-naked and immediately went to see my riads. It was total chaos, a real catastrophe, madness,” he said.  Footage on social media showed part of a minaret collapsed on Jemaa el-Fna square in the historic city.  Hundreds of people flocked to the square to spend the night for fear of aftershocks, some with blankets while others slept on the ground.  Resident Houda Outassaf said she was “still in shock” after feeling the earth shake beneath her feet.  Zara Mafoud mourns her family member Mina Akraz, a victim of the earthquake, at a health centre in the village of Moulay Brahim on Sunday. Photo: Reuters  “I have at least 10 members of my family who died … I can hardly believe it, as I was with them no more than two days ago,” she said.  The regional blood transfusion centre in Marrakech called on residents to donate blood for the injured.  “We heard screams at the time of the tremor,” a resident of Essaouira, 200km (125 miles) west of Marrakech, said. “Pieces of facades have fallen.”  The USGS Pager system, which provides preliminary assessments on the impact of earthquakes, issued a “red alert” for economic losses, saying extensive damage is probable.  The Red Cross said it was mobilising resources to support the Moroccan Red Crescent, but its Middle East and North Africa director, Hossam Elsharkawi, warned: “We are looking at many months if not years of response.”  Foreign leaders expressed their condolences and many offered aid, including Israel with which Morocco normalised relations in 2020.  Chinese leader Xi Jinping expressed “deep grief for the victims” and hope that “the Moroccan government and people will be able to overcome the impact of this disaster”.  Spain on Sunday sent 56 military rescuers and four search dogs to Morocco after receiving a formal request for help from Rabat.  The team, from the armed forces’ Emergencies Unit, took off in an A400 military plane bound for Marrakech to “help in the search and rescue of survivors,” the defence ministry said.  Qatar said it was also sending a rescue team.  A man cries as he sits on the rubble of a house in the village of Tiksit, south of Adassil, Morocco on Sunday.

A team of French volunteer firefighters arrived in Morocco on Sunday and President Emmanuel Macron said more, substantial help was available, should Morocco request it.  US President Joe Biden said he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life and devastation.  The US has told Morocco it is “ready to provide significant assistance” including search and rescue teams.  “We are also ready to release funds at the right time that can help the Moroccans recover and deal with this horrific tragedy,” Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer said.  “The United States will be with them at every step of the way when they are ready to avail themselves of what we have to offer,” he added.

Photo: AFP  Switzerland has offered to provide temporary shelters, water treatment and distribution equipment, sanitation facilities and hygiene kits.  Belgium has offered help including medical teams and field hospitals.  The Flanders region, home to a large Moroccan community, said it would provide €200,000 (US$214,270) in emergency aid through the Red Cross, while the Wallonia region has pledged to provide €500,000.  Italy has offered the help of its civil protection agency and fire service, while the Italian Catholic Church has sent 300,000 euros (US$321,400) in aid through NGO Caritas Italy.  Italian President Sergio Mattarella on Saturday stressed Italy’s “willingness to contribute to the complex rescue work”.  Turkey has offered to send 265 rescuers and 1,000 tents.  Poland and Israel said they were ready to provide help including search and rescue teams.  Iraq and Jordan have offered to provide all possible forms of help to Morocco.  The heads of the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, African Union and the European Commission, together with the presidents of France and India, pledged in a joint statement to “mobilise our technical and financial tools and assistance” to help Morocco.  Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca “pledged over US$1 million to support immediate humanitarian relief efforts with leading global non-profit humanitarian partners and through matching of employee donations”.  First responders dig in the rubble in the village of Tiksit, south of Adassil, on Sunday two days after a devastating earthquake struck Morocco. Photo: AFP  In 2004, at least 628 people were killed and 926 injured when an earthquake hit Al Hoceima in northeastern Morocco, and in 1960 a magnitude 6.7 quake in Agadir killed more than 12,000.  The 7.3-magnitude El Asnam earthquake in Algeria killed 2,500 people and left at least 300,000 homeless in 1980.  The latest earthquake also badly damaged one of the most important historical sites in the Atlas Mountains, a mosque built by a medieval dynasty that conquered North Africa and Spain.  Moroccan media reported that parts of the 12th century Tinmel Mosque had collapsed. Photographs circulating online, which Reuters could not immediately verify, showed tumbled walls, a half-fallen tower and large piles of debris.  Responding to a Reuters question about the reported damage, a Moroccan Culture Ministry source said “the ministry has decided to restore it and will make budget for it”.

       "  'Title': 'Unrelenting rain causes more than 100 landslides, traps residents in floodwaters in southern China',\n",
       "  'Text': \"BEIJING, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Days of relentless rain from the remnants of former Typhoon Haikui have caused more than 100 landslides, trapped about 1,360 residents in floodwaters and killed at least seven people in China's south, said state media.  Typhoon Haikui hit southern China eight days ago and has since been downgraded to a tropical storm, but unrelenting rain continues to deluge southwestern Guangxi.  Incessant storms in the last three days in most areas of Yulin city caused 115 landslides that destroyed roads, uprooting trees, inducing floods and leading authorities to issue a warning of emergencies on national and provincial trunk highways, state media said.  Three people remain missing and rescue operations were ongoing.  Further south near the coast, Beihai city was inundated from widespread downpour. Rescuers were seen treading thigh-deep in waterlogged areas evacuating residents in boats. About 1,360 people were trapped on Tuesday, state media said.  [1/3]An aerial view shows a flooded village in Shankou town after heavy rainfall in Hepu county, Beihai, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, September 11, 2023. cnsphoto via REUTERS Acquire Licensing Rights  The city's observatory raised its storm warning to the highest in a four-tier alert system after more than 101mm (4 inches) rain poured in a three-hour period on Tuesday morning, and flagged risks of flash floods, geological disasters and waterlogging in urban and rural areas.  Haikui, which weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall in southeastern Fujian province on Sept. 5, had last week wrecked havoc in the populous city of Shenzhen dumping historic rainfall since records began in 1952. Neighbouring Hong Kong was also pelted by the worst storm in 140 years.  Scientists warn that typhoons hitting China are becoming more intense and their paths growing more complex, escalating risk of disaster, even in coastal cities such as Shenzhen that already have strong flood defence capabilities.  China Meteorological Administration forecast heavy rains in the south and southeast parts of Guangxi on Tuesday and Wednesday, with storms in the southwest. Localised hourly precipitation could hit 70mm (2.76 inches) in some areas, it said.  The national forecaster also warned relevant departments and people in Guangdong and Guangxi to be alert to any delayed effects of disasters from frequent rainfall in recent days.

       "  'Text': 'TOKYO – Japan’s new foreign minister, Ms Yoko Kamikawa, said at her inaugural press conference on Thursday that Japan would continue seeking China to act responsibly, while maintaining dialogue to resolve common issues together.  Appointed on Wednesday as part of a cabinet reshuffle, Ms Kamikawa is Japan’s first female foreign minister in 20 years.  “We will continue to say what must be said and seek China to act responsibly, but will continue to hold dialogues on issues, and work together with them on common issues,” she said, acknowledging there were many contentious matters that need to be resolved.  “I believe we must both put in the effort to build a constructive and stable relationship,” she said, adding that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida’s stance toward China had not changed.  Most recently, relations between Japan and China cooled after Japan started releasing treated water from the wrecked Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the Pacific Ocean last month.  The move angered China, which in retaliation imposed a blanket ban on Japanese seafood and aquatic products. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'LONDON – Aviva is quitting its Singlife joint venture, selling its 25.9 per cent stake in Singapore Life Holdings and two debt instruments to Sumitomo Life for a combined £800 million (S$1.36 billion), the British insurer said on Wednesday.  The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, Aviva said.  Aviva chief executive officer Amanda Blanc said the transaction “further simplifies the business” and puts the company in “a very strong position to build on our trading momentum in the UK, Ireland and Canada”.  Aviva’s operating profit beat analyst forecasts in the first half of the year, rising 8 per cent to £715 million, helped by a strong performance in general and health insurance.  The Singlife joint venture contributed £17 million to Aviva’s operating profit in 2022, the statement said.  The proceeds from the sale will be considered under Aviva’s capital management framework, the statement said, which allows any surplus capital to be reinvested in the business, used for mergers and acquisitions, or given to shareholders.  Sumitomo Life already has a 23.2 per cent stake in Singlife, the statement said. REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'DERNA, Libya, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Survivors of Libya\\'s deadly flood described a sound like an explosion when a dam burst, a torrent rapidly rising to upper storeys of buildings and escapes across rooftops or treading water for hours in rooms flooded almost to the ceiling.  At the entrance to Derna, in eastern Libya, where a storm swelled a river and burst two dams, sending flood waters crashing through the city early on Monday, a group of survivors stood looking for shelter with their homes destroyed. Many still wore pyjamas and slippers after making sudden, unexpected escapes.  Raja Sassi, 39, survived the flood with his wife and small daughter after water had reached an upper floor, but the rest of his family had died, he said.  \"At first we just thought it was heavy rain but at midnight we heard a huge explosion and it was the dam bursting,\" he said. The city centre was littered with corpses, he said.  His wife Nouriya al-Hasadi, 31, who had clung to her small daughter through their escape, said it was \"miraculous\" that they had survived.  Safia Mustafa, 41, a mother of two sons, said they managed to flee their home before the building collapsed. They climbed to the roof and escaped across the roofs of neighbouring blocks. Her son, Obai, 10, said he was praying to God for their survival.  Saliha Abu Bakr, a 46-year-old lawyer, said she and her two sisters had survived the disaster, but her mother had died. Water quickly engulfed their building, reaching to the third floor.  The flood waters rushed into their apartment almost up to the ceiling and for what she said felt like three hours she held a piece of furniture trying to stay afloat.  \"I can swim, but when I tried to rescue my family I couldn\\'t do anything,\" she said. The flood waters receded and they left the building shortly before it collapsed with her mother inside.

       "  'Title': 'BP CEO Looney resigns over personal relationships with colleagues',\n",
       "  'Text': 'Summary  Companies Looney steps down with immediate effect  CFO Murray Auchincloss becomes interim CEO  LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - BP (BP.L) CEO Bernard Looney resigned on Tuesday with immediate effect after less than four years in the oil major\\'s top job for failing to fully disclose details of past personal relationships with colleagues, the company said.  Chief Financial Officer Murray Auchincloss will act as CEO on an interim basis, the company said.  Looney, 53, became CEO in February 2020 with a vow to reinvent the 114-year-old company, laying out ambitious plans for the British energy giant to achieve zero net emissions by 2050, and to invest billions in renewable and low-carbon power.  Looney\\'s surprise resignation came after allegations of personal relationships with company colleagues surfaced recently, prompting the company to launch an investigation.  That followed similar allegations the board investigated in May 2022. During that review, Looney disclosed \"a small number of historical relationships with colleagues prior to becoming CEO.\"  No breach of the company\\'s code of conduct was found at the time and the board was given assurances by Looney \"regarding disclosure of past personal relationships, as well as his future behaviour.\"  Looney informed BP\\'s board on Tuesday that he did not fully disclose details of all relationships, prompting his resignation.  BP shares in London ended up 1% before the FT reported Looney\\'s resignation. Its New York-listed shares fell 1.5% to the day\\'s lows after the news.  REINVENTING BP  Auchincloss 52, became CFO in July 2020 and has helped Looney steer the company through some of the most tumultuous years in modern history, from COVID-19 to a rapid exit from Russia following the invasion of Ukraine last year, an energy price shock, and a global cost of living crisis.  Bernard Looney, BP Chief Executive, speaks during a session at Egypt\\'s 5th Petroleum Show \"EGYPS 2022\" in the capital city of Cairo, Egypt, February 14, 2022. REUTERS/Amr Abdallah Dalsh/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights  Auchincloss, a Canadian national, started his career as a financial analyst in Amoco, before BP acquired the company in 1998. Since then he has held several roles including CFO of BP\\'s North American Gas business.  Earlier this year, BP scaled back plans to cut hydrocarbon production by 2030, to 25% from 2019 levels from 40% previously - still the most radical reduction of oil and gas output this decade among major oil companies.  BP has struggled to convince investors it can realise competitive returns from its non-hydrocarbon businesses.  Over the last three years, BP\\'s shares have underperformed those of European rival Shell (SHEL.L) as well as U.S. peers Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N).  After raking in a record profit of $28 billion for 2022, BP\\'s second-quarter profit slumped 70% from a year earlier to $2.6 billion but still allowing the oil major to boost its dividend by 10%.  It remained unclear if Looney\\'s departure would lead to an change in strategy.  \"Depending on the new CEO, BP could theoretically roll back its transition plans further,\" Morningstar analysts said in a note.  \"But if the board likes the current direction, regardless of the lagging stock price, they will likely bring in someone who keeps BP on the same path.\"  Looney\\'s 2022 pay packet more than doubled to around $12 million on the back of the bumper profits amid spiralling energy prices, while BP\\'s emissions were broadly unchanged from a year earlier.  BP said that \"no decisions have yet been made in respect of any remuneration payments to be made\" to Looney.  Looney replaced Bob Dudley, who had steered BP through the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010.

       "  'Title': 'Scoot among airlines, suppliers that warn of hit from RTX engine-snag disclosure',\n",
       "  'Text': 'BENGALURU - Several airlines and aerospace suppliers warned of a hit from US firm RTX’s disclosure of a rare manufacturing flaw that could ground hundreds of Airbus jets in the coming years.  RTX, formerly known as Raytheon, has said it will have to pull 600 to 700 of its Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbofan (GTF) engines from Airbus A320neo jets for quality inspections between 2023 and 2026 to check for a rare manufacturing flaw.  Scoot, a unit of Singapore Airlines, said the inspections would affect four of the engines that power its A320neo fleet and could force it to adjust some of its flights.  The latest snag, first revealed in July, could ground an average of 350 jets a year through 2026, with as many as 650 jets sitting idle in the first half of 2024.  Repair work that RTX chief executive Greg Hayes had initially expected would take 60 days is now expected to last up to 300 days per engine.  Air New Zealand, which has 16 A320neo jets in its fleet, said on Tuesday the issue will further reduce engine availability and would have a “significant” impact on its flight schedule from January 2024.  On Monday, Hungarian carrier Wizz Air estimated a potential 10 per cent capacity hit in the second half of fiscal year 2024.  The latest GTF problem relates to a rare powder metal defect that could lead to the cracking of some engine components and comes on top of a spate of durability issues that the engines are facing.  It also adds to the troubles of the airline industry, which has been grappling with shortages of staff and new planes, while piling pressure on suppliers who were just beginning to see an easing of supply chain woes.  Aerospace suppliers who have a stake in the troubled engine program also outlined their share of costs.  London-listed Melrose Industries said it faces a potential cash impact of around 200 million pounds (S$339.9 million).  Japan’s IHI and Kawasaki Heavy Industries said they expect an earnings hit from the lengthy quality inspections, following a profit warning from German firm MTU Aero Engines on Monday.  Meanwhile, at least four Wall Street analysts cut their price targets on RTX, with some voicing concern about the scope of the problem.  “When the company initially identified the powder metal issue with the GTF engine, we had confidence that the issue, based on the data provided, was relatively well contained,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a note.  “However, the financial and operational impact identified (on Monday) is more substantial than we had expected.” REUTERS',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE - Some tour agencies in Singapore face changes in plans for several tours to Morocco after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck Marrakech – a popular tourist destination – last Friday. The quake has taken more than 2,900 lives and injured over 5,500 so far.  Chan Brothers Travel said it has postponed its next group tour, which was scheduled to leave for Morocco on Thursday.  “This decision aligns with our dedication to prioritising the safety and welfare of our valued travellers, especially in the light of the prevailing circumstance,” said its marketing communications executive Samantha Tan.  Apart from this group, 10 other tour groups are scheduled to depart for Morocco between September and December, the agency said. “For those tour groups, we are actively seeking clarity from airlines, hoteliers and our land partners on postponement so that we can communicate any update to affected customers as soon as we have the information,” Ms Tan said.  The Travel Corporation said a majority of its customers who had booked trips to Morocco are proceeding as planned and only a few others have decided to switch to another destination.  “Guests on our tours in Morocco are safe and we have not postponed or cancelled any trips to Morocco. Tours are running as per normal,” the agency said.  Intriq Journey, a travel agency that provides customised and bespoke tours, said more than 15 customers had booked trips to Morocco, with most of them planning to travel between December 2023 and February 2024.  “Some are looking at different destinations, some decided to postpone and a small number of clients chose to wait and see,” said the agency’s spokesman.  She said the agency gives its customers a 24/7 emergency contact number in case they need urgent assistance while overseas.  A customer of the agency, Mr Irving Henson, was at the Atlas Mountains in Morocco when the earthquake struck.  He said his hotel was in a shambles after the earthquake struck. He contacted the emergency number given by the agency.  The agency hired a driver to take him about 300km to Casablanca, where he boarded a flight to Bordeaux in France on Saturday.  On Tuesday, Singapore’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs advised Singaporeans not to travel to places in Morocco affected by the quake, such as Marrakech, Al Haouz, Ouarzazate, Azilal, Chichaoua and Taroudant, unless necessary.  It encouraged Singaporeans to register online with it at https://eregister.mfa.gov.sg so that its officials can contact them if needed.  “Travellers should purchase comprehensive travel and medical insurance, and be familiar with the terms and coverage,” it said.  Others who had planned trips to Morocco later this year said they are either going ahead or waiting to see how the situation in the country develops before deciding.',\n",

       "  'Text': 'SINGAPORE – Olam Group on Wednesday said its Nigerian unit posted a bond for its director to “secure (his) continued cooperation… with any legitimate requests from (the) relevant Nigerian authorities for information or assistance”.  This was in reference to a Sept 11 report published in Daily Nigerian, which reported that Olam Nigeria paid a “humongous” bail bond of 1 billion nairas (S$1.9 million) to secure the release of Mr Prakash Kanth from being held by the country’s State Security Service (SSS).  Citing a payment slip seen by Daily Nigerian, the newspaper said the money was paid into a special recovery account operated by SSS.  It also claimed the payment was made by an Olam subsidiary, Microfeed Nigeria, in connection with an ongoing investigation of money laundering involving Mr Kanth.  Mr Kanth, who is director of corporate affairs and legal at Olam Nigeria, was reported by the newspaper to have spent days in the SSS detention facility in Abuja.  While Olam’s announcement confirms that a bond was posted, the group did not mention the amount paid.  “The company continues to cooperate fully with the relevant authorities and will update our shareholders and the investing public on any material developments in accordance with the requirements of the SGX-ST listing rules,” it said.  The update comes after Olam on Monday released a statement refuting allegations made through media reports – including an earlier article by Daily Nigerian – that the group and its subsidiaries were embroiled in alleged fraud involving over US$50 billion (S$68 billion).  While Olam highlighted and addressed several statements that it claimed to be inaccurate, baseless and inflammatory, the group’s board has ordered a review of the matter.

       "  'Text': 'CANBERRA – Australia will permanently cancel millions of controversial carbon credits, closing a loophole that could have been used to meet its international climate commitments.  The cancellation of more than 700 million so-called Kyoto credits – equivalent to about 150 per cent of the nation’s estimated emissions last year – means they cannot be used towards the nation’s Paris Agreement goal. Australia will also officially confirm its compliance with its Kyoto Protocol target early next year, after an international review, the energy ministry said Friday.  The government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, which came to power in May last year on a platform to end the nation’s reputation as a climate laggard, has set a legally binding target to reduce emissions by 43 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030.  While the Kyoto Protocol has been succeeded by the Paris Agreement, Kyoto carbon credits – which are tradable among countries and organisations – still hold value in some markets and continue to play a role in emissions trading schemes.  Carrying over credits from previous international climate goals toward current targets has typically been seen as a controversial carbon accounting measure, especially considering the infamous “Australia clause” in the Kyoto Protocol.  The so-called Kyoto credits negotiated at the 1997 Kyoto Climate Change Conference allowed Australia to increase its emissions between 1990 and 2012 by 8 per cent – contrary to the international treaty’s aim of mitigating global climate change – and include emissions from land clearing. Critics say they do not represent the emissions reductions required for the country to meet the Paris goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C.  “The Albanese Government has delivered on its election commitment to legislate our ambitious but achievable climate targets,” Energy Minister Chris Bowen said in the statement. “We’re closing the loophole for dodgy accounting tricks.”  Former prime minister Scott Morrison said in 2020 that he was “very confident” Australia could achieve its targets at the time without the need to use the carry-over credits, but never removed them.

       "  'Title': \"Libya's flood-hit Derna struggles to deal with corpses after huge death toll\",\n",
       "  'Text': 'DERNA, Libya - Residents and rescue workers in the devastated Libyan city of Derna are struggling to cope with the thousands of corpses washing up or decaying under rubble, after a flood that smashed down buildings and swept people out to sea.  The World Health Organization and other aid groups called on authorities in Libya to stop burying flood victims in mass graves.  They said these could bring long-term mental distress to families or might cause health risks if located near water.  Libya was hit by torrential rain from a Mediterranean storm on Sunday. The eastern city of Derna bore the brunt of the disaster.  Thousands were killed and thousands more are missing.  Since then, a UN report showed more than 1,000 people had so far been buried in mass graves.  \"Bodies are littering the streets, washing back on shore and are buried under collapsed buildings and debris. In just two hours, one of my colleagues counted over 200 bodies on the beach near Derna,\" Mr Bilal Sablouh, the ICRC\\'s regional forensics manager for Africa, told a briefing in Geneva.  Swathes of Derna were obliterated when storm water swept down a usually dry riverbed, smashed two dams above the city and brought down whole buildings while families were asleep.  The International Organization for Migration mission in Libya said on Friday that more than 5,000 people are presumed dead, with 3,922 deaths registered in hospitals, and over 38,640 were displaced in the flood-stricken north-eastern region.  The death toll could be far higher, officials say.  \"We should be afraid of an epidemic,\" 60-year-old Nouri Mohamed said at a bakery, which has been offering loaves for free to help Derna\\'s shattered community. \"There are still bodies underground ... Now there are corpses starting to smell.\"  The UN health agency together with the International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies called for better managed burials.  \"We urge authorities in communities touched by tragedy to not rush forward with mass burials or mass cremations,\" Mr Kazunobu Kojima, medical officer for biosafety and biosecurity in the WHO\\'s Health Emergencies Programme, said in the statement.  The statement called for demarcated and documented individual graves, saying hasty interments could lead to mental anguish for families as well as social and legal problems.',\n",
